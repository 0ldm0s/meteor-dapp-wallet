# Wallet √êapp

## Development

Start an `geth` node and and the app using meteor and open http://localhost:3000 in your browser:

    $ geth --rpccorsdomain "http://localhost:3000" --rpcc --unlock <your account>

Start your app using meteor

    $ cd meteor-dapp-wallet/app
    $ meteor

Go to http://localhost:3000


## Deployment

To create a build version of your app run:
    
    // install meteor-build-client
    $ npm install -g meteor-build-client

    // bundle dapp
    $ cd meteor-dapp-wallet/app
    $ meteor-build-client ../build --path "/"

This will generate the files in the `../build` folder. Double click the index.html to start the app.
To make routing work properly you need to build it using:

    $ meteor-build-client ../build

And start a local server which points with its document root into the `../build` folder,
so that you can open the app using `http://localhost:80/`
